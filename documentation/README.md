# [GM Overview](https://git.io/fjqRz)
Welcome to the overview of GreenMesa, an admirable bot for Discord created by EnigmaDigm.

GM is a _general purpose_ Discord bot that can be used in any Discord server, with the OAuth process completed of course. GM was first used (and is still mainly used in) [DigiCom](https://discord.gg/tXEDJP3). With this bot you and your server (assuming you manage a server) can accomplish many things, like: user entertainment, role assignment and management, announcements, placeholders instead of human admin messages, server statistics, and more (many of these features will be coming in force later).

## Using the bot
In order for you to use GreenMesa, it must be installed on your server, obviously. For server masters, enabling (inviting) the bot on your server will be covered in the enabling section. This section is for beginning use and basic commands (for detailed reference and super-using the bot please refer to other files in this repository).
- Bot Prefix - the GM bot prefix is $ (the symbol in front of all commands)
- `$help` - can use this command to get more information about the bot WHILE IN DISCORD, this command comes with some useful links to get you started
- `$intro` - as of now, the intro command only gives the server intro for DigiCom, coming soon will be a command center for the bot where server masters can enable/disable and or customize the command(s) for their own use
