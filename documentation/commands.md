# Bot Commmands
This page contains all commands and details for GreenMesa. This page is gauranteed to be up to date after official releases, after which unannounced updates may occur, I will do my best to keep these docs up to date if updates are pertinent to current stable version and imperative to operation of application (for maintenance, use reasons, something else).
- `$help` - `$help` - can use this command to get more information about the bot WHILE IN DISCORD, this command comes with some useful links to get you started
- `$intro` - `$intro` - as of now, the intro command only gives the server intro for DigiCom, coming soon will be a command center for the bot where server masters can enable/disable and or customize the command(s) for their own use
- `$say` - `$say <message>` - make GreenMesa say what you would like, at the moment this command is open to the public (@everyone), this may change
- `$esay` - `$esay [color code] <message>` - same as `$say`, but with this your message is embedded, and with a valid color code (integer less than or equal to 16777215) you can choose the presentation color of the embed
- `$ping` - `$ping` - the good old ping >> pong, returns 'ping?' then 'Pong! Latency is...'
- `$8ball` - `$8ball` - play 8ball
- PRIVATE - PRIVATE - UNDISCLOSED
- admin commands are not covered here
