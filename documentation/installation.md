# Enabling GM on your server
This is a very easy process:
1. When ready, go [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=560223567967551519&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdigmsl.link%2Fgreenmesa&scope=bot)
2. If needed login to Discord with the admin account you wish to use for this process
3. In the drop down menu select the server you wish to add GM to
4. There should be a single option (Administrator) already checked below the dropdown, leave this checked.
5. When happy with selections (not that there _were_ any), click authorize to add GM to your server
*NOTE:* When you click authorize you are _authorizing_ GM to access your server with full administrator privileges, please abide by EnigmaDigm Holdings [policies](https://enigmadigm.com/policies) and we will have a happy, healthy relationship. For more information refer to the Discord general documentation and if necessary developer documentation, to learn how to make a _basic_ bot yourself you can look for quick-starter docs (like on github), feel free to check out [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) (major library used for this bot that connects to the Discord API/discord.io library).
