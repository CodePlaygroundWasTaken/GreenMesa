# GreenMesa
This is the repository for a Discord bot known as GreenMesa (GM). The bot was created by, and is still maintained and updated by, Stefan Hauge. GM falls under ownership of EnigmaDigm Holdings, EnDigm Developer branch. More details about the bot can be found in the docs folder, along with all other documentation for GM (minus a few things).

If you are interested in becoming a part of the team and/or helping to develop and expand GM or EnigmaDigm as a whole, go ahead and request to become a contributor or go to [our involvement page that will soon be available](https://digmsl.link/involve1).

Details about apps on EnigmaDigm can soon be found [here](https://enigmadigm.com/apps/). We look forward to seeing you around and hopefully hearing from you.
