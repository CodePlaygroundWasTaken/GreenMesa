This is the repository for a Discord bot known as GreenMesa (GM). This page acts acts as a convenient way for @GalaxySH to store core files and other stuff for the bot. 

The application ***cannot*** merely be cloned and run immediately after installation, it will fail; this app was not built for and has not been fixed to be able to do that smoothly. There are no installers.

This bot isn't really built to run on someone else's machine (namedly you who is reading this), but mostly I'm just not going to encourage you to because, well, it's *mine*.

## Ignored files
There are *quite a few* ignored files (found in [.gitignore](.gitignore)) that are essential (more or less) to the bot's function. Especially auth.json, which contains the keys to the engine. `auth.json` is a nono file, and it will stay that way. .

## auth.json (config)
`auth.json` basic template in case there is need of a rebuild. May be out of date.
```json
{
  "prefix": "(*&%#^@$!(@*&$",
  "ownerID": "discord snowflake id here, app must be owned",
  "db_config": {
      "host": "",
      "user": "",
      "password": "w1eRd0_daTAba53_p@sW0Rd",
      "database": "",
      "port": "6969"
   }
}
```
Some required sections of the config file will be generated if not provided (the logging parts), all parts with keys are required.

## Docker

Don't try to use the Docker files.


End.
